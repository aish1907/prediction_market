P.S. - I've used Dapp University starter kit(by Gregory) that provided a basic react app setup for blockchain related projects, so you might find it mentioned somewhere in project.

What is prediction market?

Very similar to stock prediction model.
Basically a platform where people can bet on outcome of a particular event. It is based on the fact that wisdom of crowd is far better than any expert opinion. 
According to wikipedia they provide 74% more accurate results than the benchmarked sophisticated tools used today. In support popular companies like Google, Microsoft make use of internal prediction markets to predict
scenarios like sales of a product, completion of a project,etc and incentivises the employees by goodies and gift vouchers.

Benefits of prediction market on blockchain:

1) False prediction: The models used for prediction can be easily manipulated but in our model
the manipulation actually becomes incentive for correct prediction.

The model that we are building is CPMM model. It works on a simple mathematical equation
 X*Y=constant
Consider the scenario:
A buys for 100 matic 10 yes tokens, which means in the pool the number of X tokens decreased
so to maintain the constant the price of X should increase which in other words can also mean 
that cost of NO tokens should decrease.This acts as an incentivisation for the people, as now,
if somebody is trying to manipulate the market by buying false answer token we get the other token 
at lesser price which we know is eventually gonna win and would earn us extra incentive.
This is known as self scaling of markets.

2) Future fundamentals not considered: There’s a major flaw in algorithms built solely to 
predict future market moves: they don’t. They only respect the technical aspects of an
 asset by taking into account past price movements, avoiding any consideration for future
 fundamentals,whereas people on the other hand always devise moves thinking about their
 future.Not only are machines incapable of predicting a black swan event, but, in 
reality, they are more likely to cause one, as traders found out the hard way during 
the 2010 flash crash when an algorithmic computer malfunction caused a temporary market
 meltdown.

3) Transparency: At any point we can see how the opinion of crowd changes according to
prsent events, but models are of black box nature, you dont know why it says so it just 
does and you follow.

4)Freedom of speech: In countries like N.Korea and China where people are punished horribly
to open their mouths against the ruling party or ban on social media platforms, this 
would provide a way to judge the fair and foul anonymously where people would be able to
put forward their opinions and gather support.
